# Exploring the Gender Wage Gap: The Impact of Educational Attainment and Leadership Roles in the Business Sector

## üìÅ Description
The gender wage gap persists in labor markets, driven by factors such as educational attainment and occupational roles. This research examines how gender and highest degree level, particularly at the Bachelor's level, influence salary outcomes and leadership representation. Women are more likely to pursue lower-paying fields, while men dominate high-paying sectors like engineering and technology. Despite similar or higher education levels, women remain underrepresented in leadership roles, especially in the male-dominated business sector, exacerbating wage disparities. This study explores these structural and societal factors to better understand and address systemic inequities in workplace compensation.

## üñáÔ∏è Research Question
How do gender and educational attainment at the Bachelor's degree level influence salary outcomes within the business sector, and what is the interaction between gender and Bachelor's degree attainment in explaining salary disparities? Additionally, how do gender differences in occupational roles within the business sector contribute to the gender wage gap, particularly among highly paid or leadership positions?

## üî¨ Key Findings
This analysis examines gender wage disparities among individuals with a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree** as their highest educational attainment, focusing on leadership roles in the **business sector**. The findings reveal that women earn **19.7% less** than men with the same education level, even after accounting for leadership roles. However, leadership positions explain only **3.97%** of the wage gap, suggesting that broader systemic factors such as **occupational segregation, biases, and differences in career progression** play a much larger role. Salary variations across roles further highlight these disparities. High-paying leadership positions, such as **IT and engineering managers**, exhibit smaller salary reductions compared to the baseline, whereas **non-leadership roles** and **personnel management** positions show **40% and 47.8% lower salaries**, respectively. The undervaluation of these roles disproportionately affects women, reinforcing the wage gap, while men remain overrepresented in high-paying leadership positions.

From a statistical perspective, the Breusch-Pagan test confirms **heteroskedasticity**, indicating that salary disparities are more pronounced at higher salary levels, where men are disproportionately represented. However, **multicollinearity is not a concern** (VIFs < 5), and the regression model demonstrates **strong predictive power**, explaining **99% of salary variance** (R¬≤ = 0.99). These results confirm that gender, leadership roles, and other key factors effectively capture salary disparities. 

Addressing these inequalities requires organizations to implement **regular pay audits** and **transparent salary structures** to ensure fair compensation. Increasing women‚Äôs representation in high-paying leadership positions, particularly in **IT and engineering management**, is crucial. Additionally, **mentorship and sponsorship programs** should support women‚Äôs career advancement, while undervalued roles, such as personnel management, should receive fair compensation. Future research should examine **work experience, geographic location, and industry-specific dynamics** to better understand their interaction with gender and leadership roles. Policymakers and organizations must also consider strategies to reduce wage inequality across all salary levels, given the **heteroskedasticity effects** observed in the analysis.

In conclusion, while leadership roles influence salary disparities, the persistence of the **gender wage gap** underscores the need to address **systemic inequities** beyond leadership representation. A comprehensive approach that includes **pay equity policies, reducing occupational segregation, and improving career advancement opportunities for women** is essential for fostering a **more inclusive and equitable labor market**.
