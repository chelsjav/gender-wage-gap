# Exploring the Gender Wage Gap: The Impact of Educational Attainment and Leadership Roles in the Business Sector

## Introduction
The gender wage gap remains a persistent issue in labor markets worldwide, raising critical questions about the underlying factors contributing to salary disparities between men and women. Among these factors, educational attainment and occupational roles are of particular importance in understanding how systemic inequities manifest in workplace outcomes. This research investigates how gender and educational attainment, specifically the highest degree type, interact to influence salary outcomes. It also examines the role of degree types and leadership roles in shaping the gender wage gap. Educational attainment is often cited as a key driver of economic mobility, yet significant gender disparities exist in how different degrees translate into salary outcomes. For example, women are more likely to pursue degrees in fields with traditionally lower earning potential, while men tend to dominate in higher-paying fields such as engineering and technology. Moreover, occupational roles, especially in leadership or management positions, play a crucial role in defining earning trajectories. Women, despite achieving similar or higher levels of education compared to men, remain underrepresented in these roles, further increasing the wage gap. This study aims to explore the intersection of gender and highest degree level at Bachelor's to explain salary disparities and analyze how Bachelor's degrees differ in leadership roles contributing to these inequalities. This will focus on leadership roles in particularly the business sector, as business tends to be a male dominated field. This research seeks to uncover the structural and societal factors that perpetuate the gender wage gap. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing systemic inequalities and fostering a more equitable labor market where educational attainment and career choices lead to fair compensation for all, regardless of gender.

## Research Question
How do gender and educational attainment at the Bachelor's degree level influence salary outcomes within the business sector, and what is the interaction between gender and Bachelor's degree attainment in explaining salary disparities? Additionally, how do gender differences in occupational roles within the business sector contribute to the gender wage gap, particularly among highly paid or leadership positions?

## Findings
The analysis highlights significant insights into the relationship between gender, leadership roles, and salary disparities within the business sector, focusing on individuals with a Bachelor’s degree as their highest educational attainment. Women with bachelor's degrees earn approximately 19.7% less than men with the same level of educational attainment, even after accounting for leadership roles and other factors. Leadership roles explain only 3.97% of the gender pay gap, suggesting that broader systemic factors, such as occupational segregation, biases, and differences in career progression opportunities, play a much larger role. Leadership roles vary significantly in their impact on salaries, with high-paying positions like computer/IT managers and engineering managers exhibiting smaller salary reductions compared to the baseline category. In contrast, non-leadership roles and personnel management are associated with 40% and 47.8% lower salaries, respectively, reflecting undervaluation of these roles. The uneven distribution of men and women across these roles further contributes to the wage gap, with men overrepresented in high-paying positions.

The Breusch-Pagan test confirmed heteroskedasticity, indicating that the variability of residuals is not constant across salary levels. This suggests that the factors influencing salary disparities are more pronounced at higher salary levels, where men are disproportionately represented. However, multicollinearity is not a significant concern, as all variance inflation factors (VIFs) are below the acceptable threshold of 5, validating the robustness of the regression model. Furthermore, the regression model explains 99% of the variance in log-transformed salaries (r-squared = 0.99), confirming that the predictors—gender, leadership roles, and others—effectively capture the primary drivers of salary variability.

The findings have several implications. Despite accounting for leadership roles and educational attainment, the wage gap persists, indicating deep-rooted systemic inequities. Policies addressing gender biases in hiring, promotion, and compensation are essential to closing this gap. Women remain underrepresented in high-paying leadership positions such as IT and engineering management. Promoting women’s participation in these fields, coupled with targeted mentorship and leadership development initiatives, could help reduce salary disparities. Additionally, specialized roles like computer/IT managers and engineering managers command higher salaries, suggesting that encouraging women to pursue technical and specialized career paths can improve equity. Roles like personnel management and non-leadership positions, which are often undervalued, should be fairly compensated, as they are disproportionately occupied by women. Leadership positions and their associated pay scales are critical levers for reducing the gender wage gap in the business sector, but broader cultural and structural barriers, including unconscious bias, representation in decision-making roles, and equitable distribution of opportunities, must also be addressed.

To address these challenges, organizations should introduce robust pay equity policies, including regular pay audits and transparent salary structures, to ensure men and women are compensated equitably for equivalent roles and responsibilities. Mentorship and sponsorship programs should be implemented to support women’s progression into leadership roles, particularly in technical and high-paying fields such as IT and engineering management. Additionally, organizations should reexamine undervalued roles, such as personnel management, to ensure pay aligns with their organizational contributions. To address the variability in residuals (heteroskedasticity), robust standard errors should be used in future analyses, and policies should target inequities across the entire salary distribution, including both lower and higher earners. Further research should examine how additional factors, such as work experience, geographic location, and industry-specific dynamics, interact with gender and leadership roles to influence salary outcomes.

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the multifaceted nature of the gender wage gap in the business sector amongst individuals with a bachelor's degree. While leadership roles play a role in explaining salary disparities, the persistence of a substantial gender effect indicates that broader systemic factors need to be addressed. Organizations must not only promote women into leadership positions but also ensure equitable pay and opportunities across all occupational roles to build a more inclusive and fair workplace.
